    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### GET Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "* `GET /resources` - Some paginated list of stuff, in some logical default order for that data.\n",
    "* `GET /resources/X` - Just entity X. That can be an ID, hash, slug, username, etc as long as it unique to one \"resource\".\n",
    "* `GET /resources/X,Y,Z` - The client wants multiple things, so give them multiple things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sub-resources will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `GET /users/X/checkins` - Find all the checkins for a specific user.\n",
    "* `GET /users/X/checkins/Y` - Find a specific checkin for a specific user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DELETE Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "* `DELETE /places/X` - Delete a single place.\n",
    "* `DELETE /places/X,Y,Z` - Delete a bunch of places.\n",
    "* `DELETE /places/X/image` - Delete the image for a place, or:\n",
    "* `DELETE /places/X/images` - Delete all images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### POST vs PUT\n",
    "*PUT* is used if the entire URL is known and the action is idempotent. Idempotent is a fancy word for \"can do it over and over again without causing different results\".\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "PUT /places/1/image HTTP/1.1\n",
    "Host: example.com\n",
    "Content-Type: image/jpeg\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There is only one image and a new attempt is an override then `PUT /places/X/image` would be ideal. But if there are multiple images, then `POST /places/X/images` could be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example couble be user settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `POST /me/settings` - Only specific fields are POSTed.\n",
    "* `PUT /me/settings` - All fields are sent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Content Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### JSON API\n",

    "The pro is if an embedded piece of data is commonly recurring, the same resource need not to be downloaded multiple times.
