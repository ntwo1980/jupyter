    "## grep Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to employ *grep*.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ grep regexp filename\n",
    "$ cat filename | grep regexp\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a case to be made for piping commands when you with to search through content that is continually streaming. For instance, if you want to monitor a logfile in real-time for specified content:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "tail -f /var/log/messages | grep WARNING\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Regular Expressions (grep or grep -G)\n",
    "\n",
    "One limitation of basic *grep*: the \"extended\" regular expressions metacharacters—?, +, {, }, |, (, )-do not word with basic *grep*. The functions provided by those characters exist if you preface them with an escape.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Match Control\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "-e pattern, --regexp=pattern\n",
    "    grep -e -style doc.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensures that *grep* recognizes the pattern as the regular expression argument. Useful if the regular expression begins with a hyphen, which makes it look like an option.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "-f file, --file=file\n",
    "    grep -f pattern.txt searchhere.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Takes pattern from *file*. This option allows you to input all the patterns you want to match into a file, called *pattern.txt* here. Then, *grep* searches for all the patterns from *pattern.txt* in the designated file *searchhere.txt*. The patterns are additive; that is, *grep* returns every line that matches any pattern. The pattern file must list one pattern per line. If *pattern.txt* is empty, nothing will match.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "-i, --ignore-case\n",
    "    grep -i 'help' me.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Ignores capitalization in the given regular expressions, either via the command line or in a file of regular expressions specified by the **-f** option.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "-v, --invert-match\n",
    "    grep -v oranges filename\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns lines that do **not** match, instead of lines that do.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "-w, --word-regexp\n",
    "    grep -w 'xyz' filename\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Matches only when the input text consists of full words. This is the equivalent of putting **\\b** at the beginning and end of the regular expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "-x, --line-regexp\n",
    "    grep -x 'Hello, world!' filename\n",
    "```\n",
    "Like **-w**, but must match an entire line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Output Control\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "-c, --count\n",
    "    grep -c contact.html access.log\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of the normal output, you receive just a count of how many lines matched in each input file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "grep -c -v contact.html access.log\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This example returns a count of all the lines that do *not* match the given string.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "--color[=WHEN], --colour[=WHEN]\n",
    "    grep -color[=auto] regexp filename\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming if terminal can support color, *grep* will colorize the pattern in the output. Color is defined by the environment variable **GREP_COLORS**. **WHEN** has three options: **never**, **always**, and **auto**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "-l, --files-with-matches\n",
    "    grep -l \"ERROR:\" *.log\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of normal output, prints just names of input files containing the pattern. As with **-L**, the search stops on the first match. This can make *grep* more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "-L, --files-without-match\n",
    "    grep -L 'ERROR:' *.log\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of normal output, prints just names of input files that contain no matches. This is an efficient use of *grep* because it stops searching each file once it finds any match, instead of continuing to search the entire file for multiple matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "-m NUM, --max-count=NUM\n",
    "    grep -m 10 'ERROR:' *.log\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This option tells *grep* to stop reading a file after *NUM* lines are matched. This is useful for reading large files where repetition is likely, such as logfiles. If you simply want to see whether strings are present without flooding the terminal, use this option. This helps to distinguish between pervasive and intermittent errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "-o, --only-matching\n",
    "    grep -o pattern filename\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Prints only the text that matches, instead of the whole line of input. This is particularyly useful when implementing *grep* to examing a disk partition or a binary file for the presence of multiple patterns. This would output the pattern that was matched without the content that would cause problems for the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "-q, --quiet, --silent\n",
    "    grep -q pattern filename\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppresses output. The command still conveys useful information because the *grep* command's exit status (0 for success if a match is found, 1 for no match found, 2 if the program cannot run because of an error) can be checked. The option is used in scripts to determine the presence of a pattern in a file without displaying unnecessary output.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "-s, --no-messages\n",
    "    grep -s pattern filename\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Silently discards any error messages resulting from non-existent files or permission errors. This is helpful for scripts that search an entire filesystem without root permissions, and thus will likely encounter permissions errors that may be undersirable. On the other side, it also will suppress useful diagnostic information, which could mean that problems may not be discovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Line Prefix Control\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "-b, --byte-offset\n",
    "    grep -b pattern filename\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Display the byte offset of each matching text instead of the line number. The number displayed is the byte offset of the start of the line. This is particularly useful for binary file analysis, constructing (or reverse-engineering) patches, or other tasks where line numbers are meaningless.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "grep -b -o pattern filename\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A **-o** prints the offset along with the matched pattern itself and not the whole matched line containing the pattern. This causes *grep* to print the byte of offset of the start of the matched string instead of the matched line.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "-H, --with-filename\n",
    "    grep -H pattern filename\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Includes the name of the file before each line printed, and is the default when more than one file is input to the search. This is usefule when searching only one file and you want the filename to be contained in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "-h, --no-filename\n",
    "    grep -h pattern *\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The opposite of *-H*. When more than one file is involved, is suppresses printing the filename before each output. It is the default when only one file or standard input is involved. This is useful for suppressing filenames when searching entire directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "--label=LABEL\n",
    "    gzip -cd file.gz | grep --label=LABEL pattern\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When the input is taken from standard input (for instance, when the output of another file is redirected into *grep*), the **-label** option will prefix the line with **LABEL**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "-n, --line-number\n",
    "    grep -n pattern filename\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Includes the line number of each line displayed. This can be useful in code debugging, allowing you to go into the file and specify a particular line number to start editing.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "-T, --initial-tab\n",
    "    grep -T pattern filename\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Inserts a tab before each matching line, putting the tab between the information generated by *grep* and the matching lines. This option is useful for clarifying the layout. For instance, it can separate line numbers, byte offsets, labels, etc., from the matching text.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "-u, --unix-bytes-offsets\n",
    "    grep -u -b pattern filename\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This option only works under the MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows platforms and needs to be invoked with **-b**. This option will compute the byte-offset as if it were running under a Unix system and strip out carriage return characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "-Z, --null\n",
    "    grep -Z pattern filename\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Prints an ASCII NUL (a zero byte) after each filename. This is useful when processing filenames that may contain special characters (such as carrage returns).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context Line Control\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "-A NUM, --after-context=NUM\n",
    "    grep -A 3 Copyright filename\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Offers a context for matching lines by printing the NUM lines that following each match. A group separator (--) is placed between each set of matches. In this case, it will print the next three lines after the matching line. This is useful when searching through source code. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "-B NUM, --before-context=NUM\n",
    "    grep -B 3 Copyright filename\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Same concept as the **-A NUM** option, except that is prints the line *before* the match instead of after it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "-C NUM, --before-context=NUM\n",
    "    grep -C 3 Copyright filename\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The **-C NUM** option operates as if the user entered both the **-A NUM** and **-B NUM** options. It will display *NUM* lines before and after the match.\n",
    "\n",
    "### File and Directory Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "-a, --text\n",
    "    grep -a pattern filename\n",
    "```\n",

    "--binary-files=TYPE\n",
    "    grep --binary-files=TYPE pattern filename\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*TYPE* can be either **binary**, **without-match**, or **text**. When *grep* first examines a file, it determines whether the file is a \"binary\" file (a file primarily composed of non-human-readable text) and changes its output accordingly. By default, a match in a binary file causes *grep* to display simply the message \"Binary file *somefile.bin* matches.\" The default behavior can also be specified with the **--binary-files=binary** option.\n",
    "\n",
    "When **TYPE** is **without-match**, *grep* does not search the binary file and proceeds as if had no matches (equivalent to the -l option). When **TYPE** is **text**, the binary file is processed like text (equivalent to the **-a** option). When **TYPE** is **without-match**, *grep* will simply skip those files and not search through them. Sometimes **--binary-files=text** outputs binary garbage and the terminal may interpret some of that garbage as commands, which in turn can render the\n",

    "### When to Use grep -E\n",
    "\n",
    "Although almost everything can be done in *grep -G* that can be done *grep -E*, the latter has the advantage of accomplishing the task in fewer characters, without the counterintuitive escaping discussed earlier. All of the extra functionality in extended regular expressions has to do with quantifiers or subpatterns. Additionally, if any significant use of backreferences is needed, extended regular expression are ideal.\n",

    "### When to Use grep -F\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one prerequisite to using *grep -F*, and if a user cannot meet that requirement, *grep -F* is simply not an option. Namely, any search pattern for *grep -F* cannot contain any metacharacters, escapes, wildcards, or alternations. Its performance is faster, but at the expense of functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, *grep -F* is expremely useful for quickly searching large amounts of data for tightly defined strings, making it the ideal tool to search through immense logfiles quickly. If fact, it is fairly easy to develop a robust \"log watching\" script with *grep -F* and good text file listing of important words or phrases that should be pulled out of logfiles for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another good use for *grep -F* is searching through mail logs and mail folders to ensure delivery of emails to users, especially on systems with many mail accounts. This is made possible by assigning every email message a unique Message ID. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "grep -FHr Message-ID /var/mail\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will search for the fixed string *MESSAGE-ID* for all files inside */var/mail* (and recurse any subdirectories), and then display the match and also the filename.\n",
